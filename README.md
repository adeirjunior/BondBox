# BondBox

This app was created with the goal of helping you record information about important people in your daily life, whether they are friends, family members, or acquaintances. It’s perfect for those who have trouble remembering important details, avoiding the awkwardness of having to ask again.

## Key Features

- **Integrated Family Tree**: Never confuse if that relative is a cousin or nephew again. Our family tree will help you organize your family relationships clearly and accessibly.

- **Important Events**: Record special dates, such as your anniversary, and other information like the date of your first kiss, so you'll never forget meaningful moments.

- **Personality Details**: You can record personal characteristics of each person, like their hobbies, dreams, fears, and traumas. These details are invaluable in strengthening your personal connections.

- **Event Management**: Schedule meetups with your friends and note who will attend. The app will take care of sending reminders so you won’t miss those important moments.

- **Integrated AI**: To make things even easier, you can ask our integrated AI about the preferences of the people registered. For example, if you don’t remember if your friend Lara likes chocolate, just ask: “Do you think Lara would like a chocolate cake for her birthday?” The AI will respond based on stored information, suggesting the best choice, like a pineapple cake if that’s her favorite for special occasions.

- **Personal Diary**: Keep a diary where you can document the events of your daily life. While writing, you can link parts of the text to the profiles of friends, family, or acquaintances, automatically adding these events to their respective profiles in an organized manner.
